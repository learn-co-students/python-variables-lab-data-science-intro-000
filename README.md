# Variables Lab

### Introduction

Now that you know about variables, you want to use them to associate them with some data.  Here, we will be using variables to store information related to a vacation that we would like to go on.

Just as before, we ask you to run the code and ensure that it matches what is commented out.

### Learning Objectives

* Practice variable assignment in Python
* Practice variable reassignment in Python

### Assigning variables

Assign a variable of `travel_month` equal to the string "January", as that is the month you would like to travel.


```python
travel_month = None
```

> We start by setting the variable equal to the data type None.  As you know, `None` represents the absence of a value.  And now you can take care of assigning the variable to something other than `None`.


```python
travel_month # "January"
```

Now let's assign a variable equal to the number of weeks that you would like to travel, 3. 


```python
number_of_weeks = None
```


```python
number_of_weeks # 3
```

Now, you just learned that you can travel for a longer period of time.  So reassign the `number_of_weeks` variable equal to `5`.


```python
number_of_weeks # 5
```

Now that's more like it.

### Summary

Great! In this lab, you were able to get a sense how to store information in variables through assignment and reassignment.
